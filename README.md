   👀  •I just completed my master’s in Data Analytics from the University of Southern New Hampshire. Currently, I’m seeking for jobs in data Engineering and/or data science.During my grad school, I became heavily invested in data analytics through projects and courses.I'm now working to complete two nanodegrees from Udacity in data engineering and data science, as well as additional courses and credentials, before the end of this month. My credentials and certificates, those are regularly updated on my Linkedin profile.As an inspiring data scientist/engineer, my journey in data science has been full of up and downs. My take on data scientists is that we are Sherlock Holmes keen on solving mystery puzzles. It’s inspiring to take something from scratch and build a process that answers the questions we seek. Let’s say I get a kick out of designing, cleaning, and organizing something from scratch.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects.
