   👀  •I just completed my master’s in Data Analytics from the University of Southern New Hampshire. Currently, I’m seeking for jobs in data Engineering and/or data science.During my grad school, I became heavily invested in data analytics through projects and courses.I'm now working to complete two nanodegrees from Udacity in data engineering and data science, as well as additional courses and credentials, before the end of this month. My credentials and certificates, those are regularly updated on my Linkedin profile.•	As an inspiring data scientist/engineer, my journey into the world of data science has full of up and downs. My take on data scientist is that we are Sherlock Holmes keen on solving mystery puzzles. It’s quiet inspiring to take something from scratch and build a process that answers the questions we seek. Let’s say I get a kick out of designing, cleaning, and building something out of scratch.
